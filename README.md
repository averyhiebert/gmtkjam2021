# You Are A Strange World

You live in a strange world that is influenced by, and influences, your
actions, just as your brain influences your limbs and vice-versa.  We might
wonder, then, whether "you" and "the world" are, in fact, one and the same.
This is true in the game as well.

An experimental platformer made in 48 hours for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam, loosely inspired by the theme *Joined Together*.
